# Exoplanet_MCMC Demonstration

The goal of this notebook is to demonstrate the effect of different properties of astrometric data on the posterior distributions resulting from the MCMC package I have written. I will show the effect of having more or less densely sampled data, greater or fewer points included, and smaller or larger uncertainties on the observations.

## Using the module exoplanet_mcmc

To get to a corner plot of the orbital parameters of a system, only four functions must be used:

### Create an instance of System

```python
print(exmc.System.__init__.__doc__)
# Instantiates a System
#            Arguments [all without units attached]:
#                mstar - stellar mass in units of Msun
#                mplanet - planetary mass in units of Mjup
#                distance - distance to system in parsecs
#                semimajor_axis - in au
#                eccentricity
#                time_of_periastron [between -1 and 1, units of period]
#                argument_of_periastron [-2pi to 2pi]
#                timesteps - number of timesteps in an orbit

sys=exmc.System(mstar=2., mplanet=2., semimajor_axis=2., eccentricity=.2, distance=5., argument_of_periastron=np.pi/4., time_periastron=0, timesteps=40)

sys.plot_orbit()
```

### Pick a sample of the orbit to add noise to and use as observations for the MCMC

```python
print(exmc.System.generate_mcmc_sample.__doc__)
# For an instance of system, generates a sample to run MCMC on.
#            Arguments:
#                mas_unc - uncertainty in observations in mas, no units attached
#                sigma_true_anomaly - uncertainty in observations of position angle in degrees
#                sigma_mass - uncertainty in the stellar mass as a fraction of true stellar mass
#                indices - slice of the time, true_anomaly, and radius arrays to use

sys.generate_mcmc_sample(indices=[10,20], mas_unc=5., sigma_true_anomaly=3., sigma_mass=.03)

sys.plot_mcmc_sample()
```

### Generate the first guess of the parameters for the sample observations

```python
print(exmc.System.generate_first_guess.__doc__)
# Method to generate the first guess [initial position in parameter space] for the MCMC, by minimizing the
#        likelihood function.

sys.generate_first_guess()
```

### Run the MCMC on the sample of the data

```python
print(exmc.System.runmcmc.__doc__)
# Method to run emcee on an instance of System for which generate_sample_data has been run.
#            Arguments:
#                p0spread - fraction of range of parameter space which is used as variance of normal distribution to sample from
#                nwalker - number of MCMC walkers
#                nburn - number of burn-in steps
#                nsteps - number of MCMC steps
#            Note: For the EnsembleSampler default affine invariant algorithm, it is good to use many walkers and fewer steps.

sys.runmcmc(p0spread=.01, nwalker=500, nburn=200, nsteps=400)

## Plot the results

```sys.walker_plot()```

If the MCMC was run with enough steps, the plot of the walkers in each parameter space should look like "white noise", as above.

```sys.corner_plot()```

The true values of the parameters are overplotted in blue. We can see that they fall near the regions of maximum probability.
