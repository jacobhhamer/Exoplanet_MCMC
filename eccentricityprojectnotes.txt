need a parametrizable model grid, ideally a piece of data that we already know the answer to

exoplanet eccentricity
model is keplerian orbit
first, do not consider inclination, assume face on

3 cases: circular, highly elliptical but data from two different locations

make up data based on keplerian orbits

see how well MCMC reproduces eccentricity

parameters are semimajor axis and eccentricity

use emcee

takes positions and time data 

assume bound - elliptical or circular - puts constraints on parameters
	consider not constraining it to that

problem: doing MCMC for sparse data - generating data for sections
